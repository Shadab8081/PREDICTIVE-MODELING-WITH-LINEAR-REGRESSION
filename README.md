# PREDICTIVE-MODELING-WITH-LINEAR-REGRESSION
Insurance Dataset Overview
Columns:
age: Numeric. The age of the individual.
sex: Categorical. The gender of the individual (male or female).
bmi: Numeric. Body Mass Index, providing an indication of whether the individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
children: Numeric. The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
smoker: Categorical. Whether the individual smokes (yes or no).
Region: Categorical. The individual's residential area in the US (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest).
Charges: Numeric. The medical charges are billed to health insurance.
Purpose:
The dataset is commonly used to predict healthcare charges based on personal attributes such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. This prediction is typically done using regression techniques, particularly linear regression.
Usage:
This dataset can be used for various analytical and predictive tasks, including:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of individual features, relationships between features, and identify patterns.
Predictive Modeling: Build regression models to predict medical charges based on the individual's attributes.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
